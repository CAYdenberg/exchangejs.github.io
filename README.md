# Exchangejs.com

This repo hosts [the official ExchangeJS website](https://exchangejs.com). Interesting things about it:

 * We build ES6 with Webpack (see Workflow)

## Setup

First, checkout this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ExchangeJS/exchangejs.github.io.git

Open a terminal in the new directory, and install the sites dependencies:

    cd exchangejs.github.io
		npm install

## Workflow

To develop we recommend running the Webpack development server:

    npm run dev

This will launch [a local web server](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/) which automatically refreshes your page as you make changes to the Javascript. The files generated by the dev server are not written to disk. To deploy to production, you need to generate the production files.

    npm run build

Then commit your changes and when you're ready make a new pull request.

**TODO: Add tests!**
