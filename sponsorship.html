<p>Every month The Edmonton JavaScipt Meetup provides a venue, speakers, food and other resources for the local JavaScript community. Beyond this the meetup connects you, the people and organizations that make up the local JavaScript scene, with the successes, stories, and opportunities you care about.

<p>When you decided to sponsor, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oUzwmZ8MFmJjouZUGg4LEkSBiiqUQqO-1CO1lFq_GHI/viewform?usp=send_form">fill out our sponsorship form</a> and let us know your preferences.

We then clear the list of waiting sponsors and start again.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Do I need to sponsor the meetup to share a job opportunity?</h3>

<p>No. Though we encourage you to consider sponsoring the meetup, we welcome all job posting regardless of whether you sponsor or not. That said, if you're finding good people from the meetup, consider sharing the good fortune and giving sponsorship a go.</p>

<h3>Why don't you take cash donations?</h3>

<p>We've considered taking cash donations, but doing so would require registering as a not-for-profit and paying for a bank account. We'd rather spend that time and money making the meetup awesome, so ask that all donations are provided in goods and services instead.</p>

<h3>Why do you book sponsorships in advance?</h3>

<p>Booking sponsorship in advance gives us the structure we need to plan out food and other logistics in advance, knowing that we'll be able to cover the costs. By only doing this a few times a year, instead of every month, we can focus on the important tasks of arranging meetups and events.</p>

<h3>Why don't you book sponsorship more than six months in advance?</h3>

<p>Arranging the sponsorship in advance reduces the amount of time we spend chasing down sponsors, but we recognize that planning too far in advance is impractical for some organizations. Six months is a good balance between planning ahead, and not waiting to long for a sponsorship opportunity.</p>

<h3>What kind of options are available for sponsoring the meetup?</h3>

<p>There are many options available from food and refreshments, to sponsoring speakers and talks.</p>

<h3>What if I can't afford to sponsor with goods or services? Are there other ways I can help?</h3>

<p>Yes! If you'd like to help the meetup but don't have the funds to do so, consider doing a talk or contacting a member of the exec to let them know you're interested.</p>
